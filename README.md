Packet Sniffer Tool (For Educational Purposes Only) This repository contains a Python-based packet sniffer tool designed to capture and analyze network packets in real time. The tool extracts and displays important information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol types, and payload data. It provides a hands-on learning experience in understanding how network traffic works and how packets can be inspected.

 Ethical Considerations Packet sniffing is a powerful technique but can be misused if not handled responsibly. This tool is intended strictly for educational purposes and authorized network monitoring.

Do not use this tool on networks where you lack explicit permission. Unauthorized packet sniffing is illegal and unethical. By using this tool, you agree to operate it responsibly and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

Features Real-Time Packet Capture: Monitors and captures live network packets on the host machine. Protocol Analysis: Identifies and displays protocol types (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.). Source and Destination Information: Logs source and destination IP addresses. Payload Display: Shows the first 50 bytes of the packet payload (if available). Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
